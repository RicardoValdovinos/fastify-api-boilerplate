# src/common

The common directory (also called lib) contains files common to the entire application.

Currently, the directory contains a `types.ts` file, a `utils.ts` file and 2 folders. A `hooks/` folder and a `plugins/` folder for fastify hooks and fastify plugins definitions respectively.

For more information on hooks and plugins visit the [Fastify Hooks Documentation](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Hooks/) and the [Fastify Plugins Documentation](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Plugins/)
